# C# Enemy Classes Project

## Overview

This directory is dedicated to a series of exercises focusing on the creation and management of enemy classes in C#. The projects explore different aspects of class design, encapsulation, and object-oriented programming principles using a practical, game development-focused context.

## Files and Descriptions

Each file in this directory represents a different task or enhancement related to designing a `Zombie` enemy class in a game. These tasks incrementally build upon each other to create a comprehensive understanding of class functionality in C#.

- **0-enemy**
  - **Description**: Defines a public class `Zombie` that initializes a new zombie instance.
  - **Functionality**: Implements basic properties of the zombie class including health and name.
  - **Usage**: `dotnet run`

- **1-enemy**
  - **Description**: Expands on the previous task by adding more detailed properties and methods.
  - **Functionality**: Introduces methods for managing the zombie's health and actions.
  - **Usage**: `dotnet run`

- **2-enemy**
  - **Description**: Further development of the `Zombie` class to include interaction mechanisms.
  - **Functionality**: Adds methods for the zombie to interact with the environment or other characters.
  - **Usage**: `dotnet run`

- **3-enemy**
  - **Description**: Focuses on improving the encapsulation features of the `Zombie` class.
  - **Functionality**: Implements advanced property management and encapsulation techniques.
  - **Usage**: `dotnet run`

- **4-enemy**
  - **Description**: Introduces serialization capabilities to the `Zombie` class.
  - **Functionality**: Allows the `Zombie` objects to be serialized for storage or network transfer.
  - **Usage**: `dotnet run`

- **5-enemy**
  - **Description**: Enhances the `Zombie` class with additional gameplay features.
  - **Functionality**: Adds gameplay-specific features such as power-ups and interaction effects.
  - **Usage**: `dotnet run`

## Compilation and Usage

Each project can be compiled and run using the .NET Command Line Interface (CLI). To compile and run any project, navigate to the project's directory and use the following commands:

#```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
