# C# Linear Algebra Projects

## Overview

This directory is devoted to implementing linear algebra operations in C#. It includes a series of tasks that deal with vectors and matrices, demonstrating operations like addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, cross products, and matrix transformations. These exercises are crucial for applications in game development, data science, and other fields that require mathematical computation.
