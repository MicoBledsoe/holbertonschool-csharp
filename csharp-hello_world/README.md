# C# Hello World and Basic Projects

## Overview

This directory contains a series of introductory projects to C#. The focus here is on learning how to set up a C# environment, execute basic programs, and understand fundamental programming concepts like data types, variables, string manipulation, and console output formatting.

## Project Descriptions

Each project within this directory covers specific introductory aspects of C# programming:

- **0-new_project**
  - **Description**: Guides through creating a new C# console project and building it within a specified path.

- **1-new_project**
  - **Description**: Similar to the first, focusing on setting up and understanding the C# project structure.

- **2-new_project**
  - **Description**: Extends the initial setup by adding run instructions, building, and executing the console application.

- **3-writeline**
  - **Description**: Demonstrates the use of `Console.WriteLine` for outputting text to the console.

- **4-print_integer**
  - **Description**: Shows how to declare, initialize, and print integer variables.

- **5-print_float**
  - **Description**: Focuses on floating-point variables and formatting their output.

- **6-print_string**
  - **Description**: Introduces string variables and demonstrates operations like string repetition.

- **7-concat**
  - **Description**: Covers string concatenation techniques in C#.

- **8-print_variables**
  - **Description**: Explores the use of different variable types and how to print them using various format specifiers.

- **9-print_specifiers**
  - **Description**: Demonstrates advanced formatting options such as currency and percentage formats.

- **10-copy_cut_paste**
  - **Description**: Teaches string manipulation methods such as substring to simulate copying, cutting, and pasting operations.

- **11-concat_edges**
  - **Description**: Uses substring and concatenation to create new strings from parts of an existing string.

Each script provides a practical example of fundamental programming tasks in C#, ideal for newcomers to the language.

## Compilation and Usage

To work with these projects, ensure that you have the .NET SDK installed. Navigate to the project directory of your choice and follow the standard .NET build and run procedures:

#```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run

This will compile the C# files and execute the application, allowing you to observe and interact with the basic functionalities introduced in each project.
