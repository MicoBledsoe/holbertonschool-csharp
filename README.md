# Holberton School C# Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a series of projects focused on learning C#, a powerful, modern programming language designed for developing applications on the Microsoft platform. Each project within this repository explores different aspects of C# from basics to advanced topics, including data structures, object-oriented programming, and more.

## Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a C# project that covers a specific topic within the language or its application framework:

- **csharp-arrays_lists_dictionaries**: Demonstrates the use of complex data structures like arrays, lists, and dictionaries.
- **csharp-classes**: Explores the fundamentals of class design and object-oriented programming in C#.
- **csharp-delegates_events**: Introduces delegates and events, key components of event-driven programming in C#.
- **csharp-exceptions**: Covers exception handling, providing robust error management strategies.
- **csharp-generics**: Focuses on generics to provide type safety and performance improvements in collections and methods.
- **csharp-hashset_stack_queue_linkedlist**: Utilizes collections such as HashSet, Stack, Queue, and LinkedList.
- **csharp-hello_world**: Basic projects to get started with C# syntax and environment setup.
- **csharp-ifelse_loops_methods**: Implements control flow constructs and methods for procedural programming.
- **csharp-inheritance**: Delves into inheritance and polymorphism, crucial for advanced object-oriented programming.
- **csharp-interfaces**: Demonstrates the use of interfaces to enforce certain properties and methods within classes.
- **csharp-linear_algebra**: Applies C# in mathematical contexts, particularly focusing on linear algebra.
- **csharp-structs_enums**: Uses structs and enums to manage data that can be grouped together.
- **csharp-tdd**: Promotes test-driven development, highlighting unit testing and test cases in C#.
- **csharp-text_based_interface**: Develops a text-based user interface, practicing user input and screen output handling.

Each project is contained in its own folder, complete with task descriptions, implementations, and occasionally, unit tests.
