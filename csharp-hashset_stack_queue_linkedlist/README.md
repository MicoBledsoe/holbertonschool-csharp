# C# Data Structures: HashSet, Stack, Queue, LinkedList

## Overview

This directory explores various fundamental data structures in C# through practical implementations and operations. It focuses on hash sets, stacks, queues, and linked lists, each essential for efficient data manipulation and storage in software development.

## Detailed Project Descriptions

Each file in this directory serves a specific purpose, demonstrating operations on different data structures:

- **0-unique_add**
  - **Description**: Adds all unique integers from a list using a HashSet to eliminate duplicates and ensure uniqueness.

- **1-common_elements**
  - **Description**: Returns a sorted list of common elements found in two lists by utilizing intersection operations on hash sets.

- **2-different_elements**
  - **Description**: Produces a sorted list of elements that are present in one list but not both, leveraging set difference operations.

- **3-stack_push_pop**
  - **Description**: Demonstrates basic operations of pushing to and popping from a stack, along with checking and printing the top item.

- **4-queue_enqueue_dequeue**
  - **Description**: Illustrates enqueueing and dequeueing operations in a queue, showing how items are managed in a FIFO (First In, First Out) manner.

- **5-print_linkedlist**
  - **Description**: Implements a method to print elements of a LinkedList, showcasing iteration over linked list nodes.

- **6-linkedlist_length**
  - **Description**: Returns the number of elements in a LinkedList, demonstrating how to traverse this data structure.

- **7-linkedlist_add**
  - **Description**: Adds a new node at the beginning of a LinkedList, illustrating how nodes are dynamically added to the list.

- **8-linkedlist_find**
  - **Description**: Searches for an element in a LinkedList and returns its index position, employing a linear search mechanism.

- **9-linkedlist_pop**
  - **Description**: Deletes the head node of a LinkedList and returns the nodeâ€™s data, showing how to manage nodes in singly linked lists.

- **10-linkedlist_get_node**
  - **Description**: Retrieves the value of the nth node in a LinkedList, useful for accessing elements at specific positions.

- **11-linkedlist_sum**
  - **Description**: Calculates and returns the sum of all data values in a LinkedList, demonstrating accumulation operations on list data.

- **12-linkedlist_insert**
  - **Description**: Inserts a new node into a correctly sorted position within an ordered LinkedList, ensuring the list remains sorted.

- **13-linkedlist_delete**
  - **Description**: Deletes a node at a specified position in a LinkedList, showcasing node management and element removal techniques.

## Compilation and Usage
