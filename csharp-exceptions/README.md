# C# Exception Handling Projects

## Overview

This directory is dedicated to exploring various aspects of exception handling in C#. The projects here demonstrate different strategies to manage and respond to runtime errors effectively, an essential skill for robust C# application development. Each file introduces different handling techniques, from basic try-catch blocks to advanced concepts involving custom exceptions and handling specific error types.

## Detailed Project Descriptions

The following files each address a unique challenge related to exception handling in C#, illustrating how to properly implement error management within different contexts:

- **0-safe_list_print**
  - **Description**: This function attempts to print each element of a provided list up to a specified count. It utilizes a try-catch block to gracefully handle cases where the list index is accessed beyond its boundaries, preventing runtime errors and ensuring the program continues execution without crashing.

- **1-divide_print**
  - **Description**: Designed to demonstrate safe arithmetic operations, this function divides two integers and outputs the result. It includes a specific catch block for `DivideByZeroException` to handle attempts to divide by zero, thereby providing clear feedback instead of allowing the program to fail silently.

- **2-divide_lists**
  - **Description**: This method takes two lists of integers and attempts to divide corresponding elements. It's designed to handle multiple potential errors through nested try-catch blocks, including division by zero and accessing elements outside of the list's range, thus showcasing complex exception handling scenarios.

- **3-throw_exception**
  - **Description**: A simple demonstration of throwing an exception manually. This function is useful for testing error handling pathways in larger applications, ensuring that the infrastructure for exception management is correctly set up.

- **4-throw_exception_msg**
  - **Description**: Extends the concept of throwing exceptions by allowing the inclusion of a custom error message. This technique is crucial for providing more descriptive errors that can inform the user or developer about what went wrong, facilitating easier debugging and maintenance.

Each project is structured to incrementally build upon the last, reinforcing the principles of exception handling and its practical applications in everyday coding tasks.

## Compilation and Usage

To compile and run any of these projects, you must have the .NET SDK installed. Here are the general steps to compile and execute the programs within this directory:

#```bash
cd into-the-specific-project-directory
dotnet build
dotnet run

These commands will compile the C# files and execute the resulting assembly, allowing you to observe how the application handles different types of exceptions under various scenarios.
