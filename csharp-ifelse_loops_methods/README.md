# C# - If/Else, Loops, and Methods

## Overview

This directory explores foundational programming constructs in C# including conditional statements (if/else), various types of loops (for, while), and the definition and use of methods. These projects are designed to teach control flow and basic algorithmic thinking.

## Project Descriptions

Each project within this directory demonstrates key programming concepts through simple, focused exercises:

- **0-positive_or_negative**
  - **Description**: Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero and prints the result in a cleaner format.

- **1-last_digit**
  - **Description**: Checks the last digit of a number and prints whether it's greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or is 0.

- **2-print_alphabet**
  - **Description**: Uses a loop to print the alphabet in lowercase using a `for` loop.

- **3-print_alphabt**
  - **Description**: Prints the alphabet except for 'q' and 'e', demonstrating conditional logic within loops.

- **4-print_hexa**
  - **Description**: Prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.

- **5-print_comb**
  - **Description**: Prints numbers from 0 to 99 in a specific format, showing how to manipulate console output and string formatting.

- **6-print_comb2**
  - **Description**: Displays all possible combinations of two digits with proper formatting.

- **7-islower**
  - **Description**: Checks if a character is lowercase.

- **8-print_last_digit**
  - **Description**: Prints the last digit of a number.

- **9-add**
  - **Description**: Adds two integers and returns the result.

- **10-print_line**
  - **Description**: Draws a straight line in the console using a specified number of underscores.

- **11-print_diagonal**
  - **Description**: Draws a diagonal line on the console based on the input number.

- **12-fizzbuzz**
  - **Description**: Implements the FizzBuzz problem, printing numbers from 1 to 100 with 'Fizz' for multiples of three, 'Buzz' for multiples of five, and 'FizzBuzz' for multiples of both.

## Compilation and Usage

To work with these projects, ensure the .NET SDK is installed. Navigate to the specific project directory you want to run, then use the following commands:

#```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run

These commands compile the C# files and execute the resulting application, allowing you to interact with the basic functionalities introduced in each project.
