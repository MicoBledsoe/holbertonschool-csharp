# C# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

This directory is dedicated to showcasing Test-Driven Development (TDD) in C#. It includes a series of projects where tests are written prior to the implementation of functions, guiding the development process and ensuring that each function correctly fulfills its specified requirements.

## Project Descriptions

Each project within this directory is designed to teach different aspects of applying TDD principles in C# programming:

- **0-add**
  - **Description**: Implements a simple method to add two numbers and includes unit tests to validate the functionality.

- **1-divide**
  - **Description**: Features a method that divides all elements of a numeric matrix by a divisor, with tests to handle normal and edge cases such as division by zero.

- **2-max_int**
  - **Description**: Develops a method to find the maximum integer in a list. Includes tests to ensure the method handles various scenarios, including empty lists.

- **3-palindrome**
  - **Description**: Creates a function to determine if a string is a palindrome, with comprehensive tests to check both standard cases and edge cases like capitalization and punctuation.

- **4-unique**
  - **Description**: Implements a function to find the index of the first non-repeating character in a string, with tests to validate correctness across multiple string scenarios.

- **5-camelcase**
  - **Description**: Develops a function that counts the number of words in a camel case string, tested to accurately count words based on case transitions.

These projects exemplify the core practices of TDD: writing tests first to define desired functionality, then developing software to meet these specifications.

## Compilation and Usage

To work with these projects, ensure that you have .NET SDK installed. Navigate to the specific project directory you wish to run, then use the following commands to build and execute the tests:

#```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test

This will compile the test cases along with the application code and run the tests, allowing you to verify that your implementations meet the specified requirements as per the test cases.

## Additional Information

Test-Driven Development is an essential software development practice that helps in minimizing bugs during development, ensuring that the software performs as intended before it is deployed. By adopting TDD, developers can create more reliable, bug-free code, leading to higher quality software products.
